Q: Create bash scripts for installation of Ruby, MongoDB and deployment of the reddit-app. Commit scripts with executable permissions.  
A: Please find install_ruby.sh, install_mongodb.sh and deploy.sh respectively.

Q: Based on previous task, make one startup script and provide gcloud command to create an instance.  
A: Startup script named startup.sh. Command specified below:
```bash
gcloud compute instances create reddit-app \
  --boot-disk-size=10GB \
  --image-family ubuntu-1604-lts \
  --image-project=ubuntu-os-cloud \
  --machine-type=g1-small \
  --tags puma-server \
  --restart-on-failure \
  --zone europe-west1-b \
  --metadata startup-script-url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Otus-DevOps-2017-11/z37371c_infra/Infra-2/startup.sh"
```
After instance being created, you can check startup script output as following (replace project id with your own one):
```bash
gcloud compute --project=infra-189307 \  
  instances \ 
  get-serial-port-output \ 
  reddit-app \
  --zone europe-west1-b | \
  grep startup-script
```
